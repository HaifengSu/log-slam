### People
Prof. Stergios Roumeliotis

### Research

#### Cooperative Mapping
- An offline VI-SLAM algorithm
- Create optimization with constraint and solve with Lagrangian multipler
- All features and KFs are variables
- Speed up by blocking Hessian, efficient when small number of overlapping features observed
- Both point features, free lines and "Manhatton lines"

#### Square Root Inverse Sliding Window Filter (SR-ISWF)
- Compare with MSCKF

#### C-KLAM: Constrained Keyframe-Based Localization and Mapping
#### Visual-Inertial Navigation System (VINS) using a Rolling-Shutter Camera
