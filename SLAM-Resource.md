# Groups on SLAM

## [Field Robotics Center, Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/index.php)
Prof. Micheal Kaess is the author of iSAM. 
His PhD is under supervision of Prof. Frank Dellaert in Georgia Tech, and Post Doc in Prof. John Leonard in MIT.
Now he seems focusing on RBGD mapping, and optimization algorithm in SLAM.

Prof. Sanjiv Singh is the supervisor of Ji Zhang who did a great work on 3D lidar SLAM.

Focus on VINS, Prof. Stergios Roumeliotis is the second author of **MSCKF**. Cooperate with google, and participate in Project Tango.

### People
Prof. Stergios Roumeliotis

### Research

#### Cooperative Mapping
- An offline VI-SLAM algorithm
- Create optimization with constraint and solve with Lagrangian multipler
- All features and KFs are variables
- Speed up by blocking Hessian, efficient when small number of overlapping features observed
- Both point features, free lines and "Manhatton lines"

#### Square Root Inverse Sliding Window Filter (SR-ISWF)
- Compare with MSCKF

#### C-KLAM: Constrained Keyframe-Based Localization and Mapping
#### Visual-Inertial Navigation System (VINS) using a Rolling-Shutter Camera
