# Groups on SLAM

## [Field Robotics Center, Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/index.php)

## [Multiple Autonomous Robotic Systems Lab (MARS), University of Minnesota](http://mars.cs.umn.edu/)
Focus on VINS, Prof. Stergios Roumeliotis is the second author of **MSCKF**. Cooperate with google, and participate in Project Tango.

### Leader
Prof. Stergios Roumeliotis

### Research

#### Cooperative Mapping
- An offline VI-SLAM algorithm
- Create optimization with constraint and solve with Lagrangian multipler
- All features and KFs are variables
- Speed up by blocking Hessian, efficient when small number of overlapping features observed
- Both point features, free lines and "Manhatton lines"

#### Square Root Inverse Sliding Window Filter (SR-ISWF)
#### C-KLAM: Constrained Keyframe-Based Localization and Mapping
#### Visual-Inertial Navigation System (VINS) using a Rolling-Shutter Camera
